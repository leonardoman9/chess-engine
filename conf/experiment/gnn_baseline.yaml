# Override training for GNN-specific needs
training:
  max_episodes: 100  # Start small for GNN
  max_moves: 100     # Shorter games initially
  game_timeout: 20.0
  games_per_episode: 5  # Fewer games per episode due to GNN complexity
  
  # More frequent evaluation due to potential instability
  eval_frequency: 10
  eval_games: 5
  
  # Adjusted for GNN training dynamics
  training_frequency: 3  # Train more frequently
  target_update_frequency: 25  # More frequent target updates
  
  # Stockfish settings

  stockfish_time: 0.1
  
  # Logging
  log_frequency: 5
  checkpoint_frequency: 25

# Agent settings optimized for GNN
agent:
  buffer_size: 5000      # Smaller buffer initially
  min_buffer_size: 500   # Lower threshold
  batch_size: 32         # Smaller batches for stability
  learning_rate: 0.0003  # Conservative learning rate
  gamma: 0.99
  tau: 0.005             # Softer target updates
  replay_type: "standard"  # Start with standard replay

# Conservative exploration for GNN
exploration:
  strategy_type: "linear"
  epsilon_start: 0.9
  epsilon_end: 0.2
